# star-trek

The notebook star_trek_analysis.ipynb contains the code and results from the analysis. The .py script is for any annotation needed during code review. 

The model outputs and saved data is stored in the drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uAchLBfn1NwDfq01ii36dsNVz5miX4Tr?usp=share_link

If you would like to replicate the code, you can either run the code with the data folder downloaded from the drive folder, or otherwise create a data folder within
the star-trek directory and place the all_series_lines.json file from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gjbroughton/start-trek-scripts?select=all_series_lines.json
